# Project Context

## Current Status (2026-09-25)
- **Alpha Research OS** — Phase 7 shipped 2026-09-25: `ResearchAgent` safe role only (Mission §10) — 5 safe research capabilities, strict Zod schemas, provider inversion, offline deterministic mock provider, queue/verdict diagnostic seam, 0 execution/mutation pathways
- **Prior phases:** 1 (evaluator engine), 2 (research queue + multiple-testing), 3 (microstructure data), 4 (cross-sectional engine, `b7d5454`), 5 (relative-value research, `b3f51fc`), 6 (alpha composition + portfolio engine + EXTREME cost, `985c9f1`)
- **System state:** Paper/backtest only. No live capital. 2876/2876 tests passing, quality gate green, coverage 88.64%
- **Next work:** Phase 8 (paper/shadow observability per Mission §14), and known backlog items (multi-pair scan wiring, walk-forward composition, rolling-correlation, import unification, survival-gate consumption). See `docs/development-roadmap.md` §Known Backlog.

## Safety Rules
1. PAPER/BACKTEST ONLY — no real orders, no live trading
2. Never use future data in features, labels, regime detection, or execution
3. Every backtest must include fees and configurable slippage
4. Preserve existing tests and functionality
5. Small, reversible commits

## Code Standards
- TypeScript, 0 `:any` types
- File naming: kebab-case, max 200 lines
- No `console.log` in production
- Zod validation on API inputs
- YAGNI, KISS, DRY
- `npm test` must pass before commit
- Conventional commit messages
